Linkedlit is a linear data structure used to store collections of objects.
A linkedlist is made of Individual Nodes while may be present at diff mem Locations. The need not be contiguous like arrays
These nodes are connected to each other.(Linked to one other)
A Node is made of Two parts - One to store the data and a link to connect to the next node.

The First element or node in Linked List is called the Head and the last node Tail. The link of the tail node is always pointing to 0 which indicates the end of the List

The Algorithm goes as:
Create a new node with the given data
If the Linked List is empty, then make this new node the head and the tail node
Else,
    Make the link of the tail node refer to the new node
    Make the tail refer to the new node
